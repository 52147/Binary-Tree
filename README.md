# Binary-Tree
## Description
- The purpose of this exercise is to give you familiarity with Binary Trees. You will read in a lengthy text file;
- Bram Stokers Dracula as text from guttenberg.org http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/345.txt.utf-8. 
- As you read the text you will map all words to lower case, and remove all punctuation characters (Only numbers or letters should
remain) removed characters should be eaten, NOT replaced with a space. (Use the parser I will provide, it does all this).
- Once the words are pre-processed you will insert them into a binary tree.
- Each item must beanswered programmatically.
- When the binary tree is completely loaded you will perform queries to exhibit the following things:
  - How many times do the following words appear in the text?
      - transylvania
      - harker
      - renfield
      - vampire
      - expostulate
      - fang
  - What is the depth of the tree?
  - How many different words are there in the book?
  - What word is at the root of the tree?
  - Which word(s) are at the deepest leaves in the tree?
  - How many total words are in the book?
  - Which word occurs most frequently?
  - Display the first 20 words in a Pre-Order Traversal of the tree.
  - Display the first 20 words in a Post-Order Traversal of the tree.
  - Display the first 20 words in an In-Order Traversal of the tree.
